# Members only
By Héctor González Orozco

Exclusive posting app made using NodeJS, Express, Pug, and MongoDB.

Any user can view posts, but only members can see their authors, and only administrators can delete posts.

The purpose of this project is to practice providing an app with user authorization using [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/), and to manage user permissions.
